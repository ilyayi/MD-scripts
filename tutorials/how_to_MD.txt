1. create a system 
	molecule in VMD, save as xyz
	surface in Vesta, save as xyz
	convert xyz to bgf using openbabel
	minimize their energies using DFT
	make sure that BGF files comply to standard format
	use combineBGF script from ATLAS-toolkit
	USE OPENBABEL INSTEAD OF VMD TO CONVERT INTO BGF!!!
	
2. edit
	ff's - using python script to use proper ones
	sim box - use console in vmd to draw pbc from bgf, edit to have only one
	corner atom be cut through, using 1/2 unitcell for x and 1 unitcell for y,
	have vacuum from top and bottom
	
3. create Lammps Input files
	use createLammpsInput script from ATLAS-toolkit
	edit the 'in' file
4. benchmark using this script:
